### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a seft-taught **Full-Stack Developer** currently working to gain a *new* long-term position in software developement. I am also completely open to collaborating on open-source projects with high social or technical impact and private ventures with appropriate compensation. Feel free to contact me at any time! 

### My Current Preferred Stack:
- Laravel
- React
- TypeScript
- Webpack


### A bit more about me
My previous professional experience focused on **Financial Technologies** incorporating a wide variety of tools including PHP, jQuery, and COBOL. I take pride in being a developer who is consistently working to better understand software developement technologies and one that pays special attention to **Application Security**. I have a great foundation in software developement and plan to build upon that to continue my growth. My current focus is working to better understand and improve my knowledge of:

- Testing & CI/CD Pipelines
- Application Security
- Data Structures & Algorithms


### Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹
